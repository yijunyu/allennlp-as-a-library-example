# Security bugs classification through deep learning

## The [Chromium dataset](https://bitbucket.org/fayola21-lero/farsec47/src/eab43bb110e531c422b958989a22b5987c641ad4/resources/data/scrubbed/Chromium.csv?at=master) is inherited from the following paper:

Fayola Peters, Thein T. Tun, Yijun Yu, and Bashar Nuseibeh. "Text Filtering and Ranking for Security Bug Report Prediction", IEEE Trans. on Software Engineering, To Appear, 2017.

Note. Minor changes to `Chromium.csv` were applied so that JSON parser can accept the data (non-ASCII words removed).
